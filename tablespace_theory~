Managing Space in Tablespaces

Tablespaces allocate space in extents. Tablespaces can use two different methods to keep track of their free and used space:

    Locally managed tablespaces: Extent management by the tablespace
    Dictionary managed tablespaces: Extent management by the data dictionary

When you create a tablespace, you choose one of these methods of space management. You cannot alter the method at a later time.

Note:

If you do not specify extent management when you create a tablespace, then the default is locally managed.

Locally Managed Tablespaces (LMTs) are all about managing EXTENTS.

A tablespace that manages its own extents maintains a bitmap in each datafile to keep track of the free or used status of blocks in that datafile. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a block or a group of blocks. When an extent is allocated or freed for reuse, Oracle changes the bitmap values to show the new status of the blocks. These changes do not generate rollback information because they do not update tables in the data dictionary (except for special cases such as tablespace quota information).

Locally managed tablespaces have the following advantages over dictionary managed tablespaces:

    Local management of extents automatically tracks adjacent free space, eliminating the need to coalesce free extents.
    Local management of extents avoids recursive space management operations. Such recursive operations can occur in dictionary managed tablespaces if consuming or releasing space in an extent results in another operation that consumes or releases space in a data dictionary table or rollback segment.

The sizes of extents that are managed locally can be determined automatically by the system. Alternatively, all extents can have the same size in a locally managed tablespace and override object storage options.

The LOCAL clause of the CREATE TABLESPACE or CREATE TEMPORARY TABLESPACE statement is specified to create locally managed permanent or temporary tablespaces, respectively.
Segment Space Management in Locally Managed Tablespaces

When you create a locally managed tablespace using the CREATE TABLESPACE statement, the SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT clause lets you specify how free and used space within a segment is to be managed. Your choices are:

    AUTO

    This keyword tells Oracle that you want to use bitmaps to manage the free space within segments. A bitmap, in this case, is a map that describes the status of each data block within a segment with respect to the amount of space in the block available for inserting rows. As more or less space becomes available in a data block, its new state is reflected in the bitmap. Bitmaps enable Oracle to manage free space more automatically; thus, this form of space management is called automatic segment-space management.
    MANUAL

    This keyword tells Oracle that you want to use free lists for managing free space within segments. Free lists are lists of data blocks that have space available for inserting rows. MANUAL is the default.

NOTE: We can't convert the SYSTEM/UNIFORM (allocation_type) tablespace from locally managed back to dictionary managed. If, for whatever reason, we have to go back to creating dictionary-managed tablespaces, we would essentially have to create another database with SYSTEM as dictionary-managed and use export/import to move your data over. We can't go back to creating dictionary-managed tablespaces once SYSTEM has been converted to locally managed.

Dictionary Managed Tablespaces:

If you created your database with an earlier version of Oracle, then you could be using dictionary managed tablespaces. For a tablespace that uses the data dictionary to manage its extents, Oracle updates the appropriate tables in the data dictionary whenever an extent is allocated or freed for reuse. Oracle also stores rollback information about each update of the dictionary tables. Because dictionary tables and rollback segments are part of the database, the space that they occupy is subject to the same space management operations as all other data.

What is  automatic segment space management (ASSM) ?

	The ASSM tablespace is implemented by adding the SEGMENT SPACE MANAGEMENT AUTO clause to the tablespace definition syntax. ASSM tablespaces automate freelist management by replacing the traditional one-way linked-list freelists with bitmap freelists, and remove the ability to specify PCTUSED, FREELISTS, and FREELIST GROUPS storage parameters for individual tables and indexes.

What is manual segment space management (MSSM)?
	The legacy manual segment space management (MSSM) method uses a linked list called a free list to manage free space in the segment.

For a database object that has free space, a free list keeps track of blocks under the high water mark (HWM) (HWM), which is the dividing line between segment space that is used and not yet used. As blocks are used, the database puts blocks on or removes blocks from the free list as needed.
